<h1>Creating an Active Directory Infrastructure in the Cloud with Microsoft Azure</h1>


In this project, we set up the foundation for an Active Directory environment in Microsoft Azure. We use a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine as the Domain Controller and a Windows 10 virtual machine as the client.

We assign static private IP addresses, configure custom DNS settings, and test network connectivity using PowerShell and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). This setup prepares us to deploy and manage Active Directory services for future projects.
<br />

<h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites</h2>
- [Creating Virtual Machines in the Cloud](https://github.com/ajowyit/creating-virtual-machines)
*(Refer to this project for help creating Virtual Manchines if necessary)*

- A Microsoft Azure account and subscription with access to:
  - Resource Group creation
  - Virtula Network configuration
  - Deployment of Windows Server and Windows 10 virtual machines

- Remote Desktop Connection (RDP) access and the Windows App

<h2>üíª Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop (Windows App)
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Operating Systems Used </h2>

- macOS Sequoia
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>ü™ú High-Level Steps</h2>

- Step 1: Create Resource Group, Virtual Network and Virtual Machines
- Step 2: Assign a Static Private IP to DC-1

</p>
<p>
- Log into the Azure Portal and navigate to Resource groups.
</p>
<p>
- Create a new resource group.
</p>

</p>
<p>
  - Create a virtual network inside of the resource group we created. Make sure it is in the same region.
</p>

</p>

<p>
- Create two virtual machines. Make sure that the virtual machines are in the same   Virtual Network and Region as the resource group we created. 
</p>

### üñ•Ô∏è VM #1: Domain Controller (DC-1)

- **Name**: `DC-1`
- **Image**: Windows Server 2022
- **Size**: At least 2 vCPUs, 8 GiB memory 
- **Authentication**: Password
- **Network**: Place inside the same Virtual Network and Resource Group we created

### üíª VM #2: Client Machine (Client-1)

- **Name**: `Client-1`
- **Image**: Windows 10 Pro (22H2)
- **Size**: At least 2 vCPUs, 8 GiB memory
- **Authentication**: Password
- **Network**: Make sure to use the same Virtual Network and Region as DC-1

<br />

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Assign a Static Private IP to DC-1</h2>

</p>

<p>
- Navigate back to the Virtual machines page. Click on DC-1. Select Network settings. Click the Network interface/IP configuration option.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
- Under IP Settings, click ipconfig1 to edit IP configuration. Select Static under Allocation to change the alloaction from Dynamic to Static. Click Save.
</p>
<p>
-A static internal IP ensures that the DNS server (DC-1) consistently uses the same address, which is crucial for domain joining and reliable communication with client machines.

</p>
<p>
  - Confirm our changes were saved by looking to see that out Private IP address is static. Congratulations, we have finished setting up our Active Directory Infrastructure!
